# Advent of Code 2025 - Development Patterns

## Project Overview
This is a Vue 3 + TypeScript project for solving Advent of Code 2025 challenges with a visual interface.

## Development Workflow for New Days

When starting a new day (e.g., Day 3, Day 4, etc.), follow this workflow:

### 1. Create solve.ts file
- Create `src/views/dayN/solve.ts` with the solution logic
- Export `solvePart1()` and `solvePart2()` functions
- Keep functions pure - they should accept input as a string parameter and return the result
- Example structure:
```typescript
export function solvePart1(input: string): number {
  // Solution logic
}

export function solvePart2(input: string): number {
  // Solution logic
}
```

### 2. Write tests
- Create `src/views/dayN/solve.test.ts` 
- Write tests using the example inputs from the Advent of Code problem
- Test both parts of the puzzle
- Ensure all tests pass before moving to UI

### 3. Wire up the UI
- Create or update `src/views/dayN/DayN.vue`
- Use the `useInputLoader` composable to load input files
- Import and call `solvePart1()` and `solvePart2()` from `solve.ts`
- Display results in the UI
- **IMPORTANT**: Display answers as raw numbers without formatting (no commas, no `.toLocaleString()`)

### 4. Verify with Playwright
- After implementing the solution, verify the work by testing in the browser at `http://localhost:5173/`
- Use Playwright MCP server to:
  - Navigate to the day's page (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/day7`)
  - Verify the input loads correctly (NOT HTML content - this indicates the input file path is wrong)
  - Click the "Solve" button
  - Verify both Part 1 and Part 2 answers are displayed correctly
  - Take screenshots to confirm visual appearance
- **Common Issue**: If the input textarea shows HTML instead of puzzle data, the `useInputLoader` is loading the wrong file path. Check that:
  - The file is in `public/` directory
  - The filename exactly matches the pattern `DayNInput.txt`
  - The `useInputLoader` call uses just the filename, not a path

## File Structure
```
src/
  views/
    dayN/
      solve.ts          # Pure solution functions
      solve.test.ts     # Unit tests
      DayN.vue          # UI component
  composables/
    useInputLoader.ts   # For loading input files
```

## Testing
- Run tests: `npm run test:run`
- Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test`
- Tests should be fast and deterministic
- Avoid console output in production code (it creates noise in test output)

## Input Files
- **IMPORTANT**: Place puzzle inputs in `public/DayNInput.txt` (e.g., `Day1Input.txt`, `Day7Input.txt`)
- Use the exact naming pattern: `Day` + number + `Input.txt` (no hyphens, capital D, capital I)
- Input files are loaded via fetch using `useInputLoader`
- In your Vue component, use: `const { input } = useInputLoader('Day7Input.txt')`
- DO NOT include folder paths in the filename - files in `public/` are served from the root

## Code Style
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Prefer pure functions for solution logic

## Performance and Algorithm Selection

### When to Optimize
- **Red flags**: If your solution needs arbitrary size limits, takes >5 seconds, or times out
- **Target**: Most solutions should complete in under 1 second, ideally under 100ms
- If a solution is slow, reconsider the algorithm before adding limits or optimizations

### Common Patterns
1. **Geometry Problems**: Consider AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection for rectangle/shape intersection problems instead of checking every point
2. **Polygon Operations**: AABB collision is O(edges), point-by-point checking is O(area) - prefer edge-based approaches
3. **Graph Problems**: BFS/DFS are usually sufficient, avoid complex shortest-path algorithms unless needed
4. **Search Problems**: Binary search, hash maps, and sets can often replace nested loops

### Algorithm Complexity
- Be aware of complexity:
  - O(n) or O(n log n): Usually fine for n up to millions
  - O(n²): Usually fine for n up to thousands
  - O(n³) or O(area): Often too slow for large inputs
- If checking every element in a large space (coordinates, grid cells), look for a geometric or mathematical shortcut

### Learning from Others
- If stuck or solution is slow, look at how others solved it
- GitHub search: "advent of code 2025 day N" can provide alternative approaches
- Pay attention to simplicity - cleaner solutions are often faster and more correct
